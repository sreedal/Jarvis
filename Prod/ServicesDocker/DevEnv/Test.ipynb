In their filing, the Justice Department and FCC argued that if the states, led by New York and California, succeed in killing the deal the end result will be that rural areas of the United States will be slower to get access to 5G, the next generation of wireless.  The Justice Department approved the merger in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish.<p><br clear=\"all\">'},\n",

In the chamber of the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, the American ambassador to the UN walked over to her Iranian counterpart\\xa0to offer condolences.Kelly Craft was responding to a speech by Majid Takht-Ravanchi, in which the Iranian ambassador mourned the death of Ava, a two-year-old girl in Tehran, whose doctors had been unable to procure bandages for skin blisters\\xa0caused by a rare genetic disease. Takht-Ravanchi\\xa0blamed U.S. sanctions — specifically, their impact on supplies of essential medicines. It would’ve been easy enough to dismiss the story as a disingenuous play for sympathy, and an opportunistic attempt to deflect blame\\xa0by a regime that has in recent weeks slaughtered hundreds of its own citizens\\xa0— including children. But Craft was right to express compassion for the plight of ordinary Iranians. In fact, a\\xa0bigger, more meaningful gesture is long overdue: making sure no other Ava\\xa0need die for her government’s faults. Medicines and foodstuffs are exempted from the U.S. sanctions on Iran, but the prospect of punishment has spooked potential suppliers, and especially foreign banks. Although this problem is easily fixed, President Donald Trump’s administration has been shamefully tardy in doing so.What it will take is for the U.S. to green-light a proposed Swiss channel for humanitarian trade, and to expand the channel’s mandate to include non-Swiss suppliers. The channel has been in the works for more than a year. The most obvious European beneficiaries would be Swiss drugmakers Roche Holding AG\\xa0and\\xa0Novartis AG,\\xa0and the food group\\xa0Nestle SA, which have a long history of trade with Iran.\\xa0But there’s no logical reason other companies, even American ones, shouldn’t be allowed to use the conduit.U.S. authorities have blocked the channel, mainly by dragging their feet in clarifying\\xa0what they would and would not allow\\xa0through it. Some progress was announced in October, and still more earlier this month.This isn’t good enough. While it’s true that the Iranian regime uses the sanctions as a convenient cover for its own failings — and some of the medical shortages are of its own making — there’s no gainsaying that\\xa0trade restrictions inflict real pain on many people. Human-rights groups have documented how the sanctions harm Iranians’ right to health.At the same time, they have encouraged European governments to seek alternative routes\\xa0such as Instex, a so-called “special purpose vehicle” designed to sidestep the American financial\\xa0system. It hasn’t worked yet. But it has put the Trump administration in the unedifying position of threatening its allies over humanitarian trade.American intransigence on this has also given Iran a stick with which to beat the Europeans. When not shedding crocodile tears over Ava, the regime in Tehran threatens to ratchet up its enrichment of uranium, unless Europe opens up trade channels. By clearing the legal and bureaucratic path for the Swiss channel, the Trump administration would not only be doing the right thing by the Iranian people, it would be revealing the regime’s threats for what they are: nuclear blackmail. It would also free the Europeans to impose sanctions of their own, guilt-free.All of this is long overdue. But if politics requires a propitious moment for the big gesture, it so happens that one is close at hand: January marks the 40th anniversary of Switzerland’s role as the de-facto representative of American interests in Tehran.

And there are a couple of reasons for this.For one, stock buybacks help push up the stock price.In addition, over time the smaller number of shares outstanding allows the company the raise the dividend per share. The stock buybacks reduce the number of shareholders who are entitled to the same dividends. Therefore, a larger increase makes more sense than otherwise.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI researched this and found five well-capitalized dividend stocks with large stock buyback programs. These stocks are also very cheap, with low price-to-earnings ratios.In addition, the buyback yield, which is the buyback program divided by the market value of the stock, is often higher than the dividend yield. Companies tend to spend more on buybacks than dividends as a way to return capital to shareholders.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd It turns out that the total yield, which is dividend yield added to buyback yield, is a good predictor of shareholder returns. Dividend Stocks: Wells Fargo (WFC)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 3.79%Buyback Yield: 13.05%Total Yield: 16.84%Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock benefits from a large buyback program. WFC received approval in late June from the Federal Reserve for up to $23 billion in buybacks. The company recently bought back $7.5 billion in shares during the latest quarter. That made it one of the top three buyback companies in the U.S.At this rate, Wells Fargo will buy back $30 billion in shares over the next year. That represents over 13% of its $227 billion in market value over the next year. Combined with its 3.79% dividend yield, the buyback yield together makes a total yield of 16.8%WFC stock is cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings of just 12.5 times. Shareholders should expect a good return on WFC stock with the company returning so much capital to shareholders. Expedia (EXPE)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 1.2%Buyback Yield: 10.4%Total Yield: 11.6%Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) will significantly benefit from a massive buyback program announced on Dec. 4, 2019. Barry Diller, the CEO, fired management and immediately announced a new 20 million share buyback program.Moreover, EXPE has an existing 9 million share buyback program. There are about 145 million shares outstanding. Therefore, the buybacks represent over 20% of its market value over the next two years. I wrote an article recently about this intriguing situation. The buyback yield is over 10% per year. The total yield is over 11.6% per year.Moreover, Barry Diller, who controls over 49% of the voting stock, said he would also start buying more shares for himself. That is fantastic. It will have the same effect as a buyback on top of a buyback.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 So look for really good things to happen to EXPE stock. It is reasonably cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 16 times. In my article, I estimated that the true value of Expedia stock is over $124 per share. That represents a return of at least 12% to investors. Intel (INTC)Dividend Yield: 2.2%Buyback Yield: 5.5%Total Yield: 7.7%Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has a total yield of 7.7%. Like most of the other companies here, most of this yield comes from the INTC&#39;s buyback yield of 5.5%.Intel&#39;s board recently updated its buyback program. They added $20 billion to its existing $7.2 billion share repurchase program. Therefore, over the next two years, the $13.6 billion in buybacks represent a 5.5% buyback yield. This is because the Intel stock market value is $249 billion.Moreover, Intel stock has a very cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12.5 times. This will allow the company to buy back shares at a very cheap price.I recently wrote an article about INTC stock. I estimated the true value is over $65 per share. This represents a potential return of 14% to investors. Shareholders should expect a minimum total return of at least 7.7% per annum as INTC continues its buybacks. Janus Henderson Group (JHG)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 5.8%Buyback Yield: 4.4%Total Yield: 10.2%Janus Henderson (NYSE:JHG) stock benefits from both a high dividend yield and a high buyback yield, as you can see in the chart above. So this gives the fund management company, based in the U.K. and Denver, a high total yield of over 10% for shareholders.For example, based on my calculations in a recent article I wrote, JHG buys about $200 million of its own shares a year. JHG stock has a market value of over $4.5 billion. So the buyback program represents a 4.4% buyback yield. This will both help the dividend per share rise faster than otherwise, and also help push up the price of Janus Henderson stock.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy In addition, JHG stock is very cheap. It trades for just 10 times earnings. So, given that the total yield is over 10%, including the dividend and buyback yields, investors should do well over time. Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 2.98%Buyback Yield: 13.35%Total Yield: 16.33%Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) stock has a very high total yield. This server and cloud storage company -- not Hewlett Packard, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) the printer company -- has a $20.5 billion market value.HPE&#39;s capital return program of $7 billion over two years, including dividends, represents a buyback yield of over 13.3% per year (i.e. $2.7 billion in annual buybacks divided by its $20.5 billion market value). In addition, HPE stock has a nice 3% dividend yield.HPE is also very cheap at 8 times forward earnings. Combined with its high total yield, investors in HPE stock should do quite well over the next year. I recently wrote an article on HPE stock. I estimated its value at $25.84 per HPE share. This is an estimated return of over 60% for investors.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 1.2%Buyback Yield: 10.4%Total Yield: 11.6%Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) will significantly benefit from a massive buyback program announced on Dec. 4, 2019. Barry Diller, the CEO, fired management and immediately announced a new 20 million share buyback program.Moreover, EXPE has an existing 9 million share buyback program. There are about 145 million shares outstanding. Therefore, the buybacks represent over 20% of its market value over the next two years. I wrote an article recently about this intriguing situation. The buyback yield is over 10% per year. The total yield is over 11.6% per year.Moreover, Barry Diller, who controls over 49% of the voting stock, said he would also start buying more shares for himself. That is fantastic. It will have the same effect as a buyback on top of a buyback.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 So look for really good things to happen to EXPE stock. It is reasonably cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 16 times. In my article, I estimated that the true value of Expedia stock is over $124 per share. That represents a return of at least 12% to investors. Intel (INTC)Dividend Yield: 2.2%Buyback Yield: 5.5%Total Yield: 7.7%Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has a total yield of 7.7%. Like most of the other companies here, most of this yield comes from the INTC&#39;s buyback yield of 5.5%.Intel&#39;s board recently updated its buyback program. They added $20 billion to its existing $7.2 billion share repurchase program. Therefore, over the next two years, the $13.6 billion in buybacks represent a 5.5% buyback yield. This is because the Intel stock market value is $249 billion.Moreover, Intel stock has a very cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12.5 times. This will allow the company to buy back shares at a very cheap price.I recently wrote an article about INTC stock. I estimated the true value is over $65 per share. This represents a potential return of 14% to investors. Shareholders should expect a minimum total return of at least 7.7% per annum as INTC continues its buybacks. Janus Henderson Group (JHG)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 5.8%Buyback Yield: 4.4%Total Yield: 10.2%Janus Henderson (NYSE:JHG) stock benefits from both a high dividend yield and a high buyback yield, as you can see in the chart above. So this gives the fund management company, based in the U.K. and Denver, a high total yield of over 10% for shareholders.For example, based on my calculations in a recent article I wrote, JHG buys about $200 million of its own shares a year. JHG stock has a market value of over $4.5 billion. So the buyback program represents a 4.4% buyback yield. This will both help the dividend per share rise faster than otherwise, and also help push up the price of Janus Henderson stock.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy In addition, JHG stock is very cheap. It trades for just 10 times earnings. So, given that the total yield is over 10%, including the dividend and buyback yields, investors should do well over time. Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 2.98%Buyback Yield: 13.35%Total Yield: 16.33%Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) stock has a very high total yield. This server and cloud storage company -- not Hewlett Packard, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) the printer company -- has a $20.5 billion market value.HPE&#39;s capital return program of $7 billion over two years, including dividends, represents a buyback yield of over 13.3% per year (i.e. $2.7 billion in annual buybacks divided by its $20.5 billion market value). In addition, HPE stock has a nice 3% dividend yield.HPE is also very cheap at 8 times forward earnings. Combined with its high total yield, investors in HPE stock should do quite well over the next year. I recently wrote an article on HPE stock. I estimated its value at $25.84 per HPE share. This is an estimated return of over 60% for investors.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

That&#39;s because it&#39;s in our nature to look for the rags-to-riches story. Plus, let&#39;s face it -- on more than one occasion, a stock that was left for dead has rebounded to reach new heights.However, the reality is that in just as many cases, stocks that are falling will continue to fall. And while this doesn&#39;t mean a stock can&#39;t turn around, it often times means that the stock may have further to fall.How can investors tell the difference? An easy clue for investors to follow is to look at what analysts say about a stock. Analysts are typically assigned to a handful of specific stocks, or they may cover specific sectors. That means they will frequently have contacts within the companies that involve those stocks, which helps them understand the fundamentals of a company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAn analyst&#39;s recommendation is particularly important whenever a stock issues its periodic earnings report. That&#39;s because, in addition to companies posting the results of the quarter just passed, they offer guidance for future results. After analyzing all this information, they issue a buy, hold or sell rating. Although the ratings seem straightforward, many investors know that hold has actually come to mean sell. So, when a stock gets a sell rating, it means analysts have a particularly negative impression of a stock.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd The moral of the story, when a stock gets a sell rating, it&#39;s important to get out before further damage is done to your portfolio. With that being said, take a look at these three stocks to sell and consider kissing them goodbye before we enter 2020.   Stocks to Sell Before 2020: Nio (NIO)Source: THINK A / Shutterstock.com Year-to-Date Performance: -58%In a prior article, I said that the electric car industry is similar to the cannabis sector in that there will be some companies that will be first through the door, but won&#39;t be there when the industry consolidation is finished. That may very well be the case with Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock.Nio has been given the nickname &quot;Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China,&quot; but has a lot of obstacles that are getting in the way of their growth. One of those obstacles is that the company has yet to turn a profit -- and the path to profit does not look very clear. The upper class in China is not as robust as many think. This is creating a supply and demand problem that is hard to ignore.Furthermore, the Chinese government has removed the subsidies from electric cars -- which is creating even more of a demand problem.Nio also doesn&#39;t manufacture its own product, which makes it difficult to get a true valuation of the company. Nautilus (NLS)Source: Shutterstock YTD Performance: -84%It&#39;s hard to imagine that investors would be questioning a fitness company&#39;s stock; Nonetheless, that&#39;s the case with Nautilus (NYSE:NLS). The stock is down over 80% in 2019, and reported an earnings per share (EPS) loss of 36 cents. This was 32 cents worse than analysts&#39; estimates this past quarter. This made it three-straight quarters that the company reported a negative EPS -- and that&#39;s not an encouraging trend.However, what makes the situation worse is that Nautilus is struggling to perform in its key Bowflex business. The company blamed a slow start to the year on advertising that failed to get across the company&#39;s new digital benefits.  * 5 Retail Stocks That Are Winning Big This Holiday Season But, in a fitness space that is getting more crowded by the day, it&#39;s simply not credible to believe that the problem with the company&#39;s Bowflex business is due to poor advertising. Especially when a brand like Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) is showing that even negative publicity can be good publicity. J.Jill (JILL)Source: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com YTD Performance: -82%As I mentioned in the introduction, when analysts give a hold rating, it frequently means it&#39;s time to sell the stock. So, when five of the nine analysts that offered ratings on J.Jill (NYSE:JILL) gave the stock a &quot;hold&quot; rating, that can&#39;t be good news.One of the problems that bedevil J.Jill is its inability to deliver consistently positive earnings. The company managed to break a four-quarter streak of declining earnings in the first quarter of 2019. However, the stock quickly reported a decline in earnings in the second quarter -- and not just a decline, JILL&#39;s stock actually reported negative earnings. They broke the string in the third quarter, ticking back to positive and only missing analysts&#39; expectations by 4 cents; But, a miss is still a miss. Furthermore, the company&#39;s fourth-quarter guidance is also showing another decline in earnings.For a stock that&#39;s already down 82% for the year, that kind of performance is not going to inspire investors. This is particularly true when the company cites one of the reasons for its poor sales number in the first quarter as a shift from catalog to digital sales that was too aggressive. It&#39;s hard to imagine that such a thing is possible.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

That&#39;s because it&#39;s in our nature to look for the rags-to-riches story. Plus, let&#39;s face it -- on more than one occasion, a stock that was left for dead has rebounded to reach new heights.However, the reality is that in just as many cases, stocks that are falling will continue to fall. And while this doesn&#39;t mean a stock can&#39;t turn around, it often times means that the stock may have further to fall.How can investors tell the difference? An easy clue for investors to follow is to look at what analysts say about a stock. Analysts are typically assigned to a handful of specific stocks, or they may cover specific sectors. That means they will frequently have contacts within the companies that involve those stocks, which helps them understand the fundamentals of a company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAn analyst&#39;s recommendation is particularly important whenever a stock issues its periodic earnings report. That&#39;s because, in addition to companies posting the results of the quarter just passed, they offer guidance for future results. After analyzing all this information, they issue a buy, hold or sell rating. Although the ratings seem straightforward, many investors know that hold has actually come to mean sell. So, when a stock gets a sell rating, it means analysts have a particularly negative impression of a stock.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd The moral of the story, when a stock gets a sell rating, it&#39;s important to get out before further damage is done to your portfolio. With that being said, take a look at these three stocks to sell and consider kissing them goodbye before we enter 2020.   Stocks to Sell Before 2020: Nio (NIO)Source: THINK A / Shutterstock.com Year-to-Date Performance: -58%In a prior article, I said that the electric car industry is similar to the cannabis sector in that there will be some companies that will be first through the door, but won&#39;t be there when the industry consolidation is finished. That may very well be the case with Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock.Nio has been given the nickname &quot;Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China,&quot; but has a lot of obstacles that are getting in the way of their growth. One of those obstacles is that the company has yet to turn a profit -- and the path to profit does not look very clear. The upper class in China is not as robust as many think. This is creating a supply and demand problem that is hard to ignore.Furthermore, the Chinese government has removed the subsidies from electric cars -- which is creating even more of a demand problem.Nio also doesn&#39;t manufacture its own product, which makes it difficult to get a true valuation of the company. Nautilus (NLS)Source: Shutterstock YTD Performance: -84%It&#39;s hard to imagine that investors would be questioning a fitness company&#39;s stock; Nonetheless, that&#39;s the case with Nautilus (NYSE:NLS). The stock is down over 80% in 2019, and reported an earnings per share (EPS) loss of 36 cents. This was 32 cents worse than analysts&#39; estimates this past quarter. This made it three-straight quarters that the company reported a negative EPS -- and that&#39;s not an encouraging trend.However, what makes the situation worse is that Nautilus is struggling to perform in its key Bowflex business. The company blamed a slow start to the year on advertising that failed to get across the company&#39;s new digital benefits.  * 5 Retail Stocks That Are Winning Big This Holiday Season But, in a fitness space that is getting more crowded by the day, it&#39;s simply not credible to believe that the problem with the company&#39;s Bowflex business is due to poor advertising. Especially when a brand like Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) is showing that even negative publicity can be good publicity. J.Jill (JILL)Source: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com YTD Performance: -82%As I mentioned in the introduction, when analysts give a hold rating, it frequently means it&#39;s time to sell the stock. So, when five of the nine analysts that offered ratings on J.Jill (NYSE:JILL) gave the stock a &quot;hold&quot; rating, that can&#39;t be good news.One of the problems that bedevil J.Jill is its inability to deliver consistently positive earnings. The company managed to break a four-quarter streak of declining earnings in the first quarter of 2019. However, the stock quickly reported a decline in earnings in the second quarter -- and not just a decline, JILL&#39;s stock actually reported negative earnings. They broke the string in the third quarter, ticking back to positive and only missing analysts&#39; expectations by 4 cents; But, a miss is still a miss. Furthermore, the company&#39;s fourth-quarter guidance is also showing another decline in earnings.For a stock that&#39;s already down 82% for the year, that kind of performance is not going to inspire investors. This is particularly true when the company cites one of the reasons for its poor sales number in the first quarter as a shift from catalog to digital sales that was too aggressive. It&#39;s hard to imagine that such a thing is possible.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But in hindsight, it looks more like a costly lump of coal.”Horsley, NPR&#39;s chief economics correspondent, says the economy appears to have received a short-term boost from the tax cuts, but the effect wore off quickly. Overall, the tax cut package pushed through Congress on a party-line vote has failed to fulfill its promises, he says, providing details on some key issues:\\xa0  * While President Trump said the tax cuts were meant to help “the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America,&quot; more than half of the tax savings went to the top 20% of the income distribution, and corporations received the biggest cuts.  * Trump portrayed the tax cuts as “rocket fuel for our economy&quot; and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said “America is ready to take off” when the tax cuts passed, but the economy grew at the same pace in 2018 (2.9%) that it did in 2015.  * Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the tax plan would pay for itself, but we’re facing $1 trillion deficits for years to come instead. “The tax cuts were never going to — and have not — come anywhere close to paying for themselves,&quot; said Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell also took aim at the GOP tax cuts this week, saying Thursday that they were like a toddler who is “way behind on nearly all its developmental milestones.” Hitting on many of the same points as Horsley, Rampell mockingly proclaimed, “Welcome to your terrible twos, GOP tax cuts!”And lest you think the bad reviews are only coming from the ostensibly liberal mainstream media, journalists aren’t the only ones offering critical remarks.Earlier this week, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley was asked about how the tax law would affect Trump in the 2020 election. The Iowa Republican said that while it probably wouldn’t hurt the president, “it definitely hasn&#39;t been any help to us.&quot; Most Americans received some kind of tax cut, Grassley said, but it was too small for most people to notice in their paychecks. &quot;You don&#39;t notice it, so you don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; he said.Like what you&#39;re reading?

That said, it&#39;s pretty clear bulls are in control at the moment. Let&#39;s look at a few top stock trades for Monday, the last full trading day before the holidays. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Uber (UBER)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comIt&#39;s a Christmas miracle, with Uber (NYSE:UBER) finally putting together some bullish developments.Earlier this month, the stock notched a higher low, allowing us to draw an uptrend mark (purple line) on the chart. Then it pushed through the 50-day moving average and the $30 level.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsObviously the stock still has a lot to prove, but it&#39;s making positive steps. It&#39;s also a great example of why traders should keep an open mind and do their best to approach each stock without a bias.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd If Uber can stay above $30, the 61.8% retracement at $33.79 may be the next stop. On a move below $30 and the 50-day moving average, see if uptrend support buoys the name. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Netflix (NFLX)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMan, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been on a tear lately. Just earlier this month, it was flirting with a breakdown below $290. Now up near $336, the rally has added almost $50 to the stock price.Is it running out of gas?Earlier this year, the $340 level was big-time support, along with the 200-day moving average. NFLX didn&#39;t have much trouble reclaiming the latter, but as it nears the former in an overbought condition, prudent bulls are surely raising stops and booking some profits.If NFLX surges through $340, a gap-fill up near $360 will surely be bulls&#39; preferred target. If $340 is resistance, see if the 200-day moving average acts as support. Below puts uptrend support in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Xilinx (XLNX)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comNot one we visit with often, but Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) was popping up on traders&#39; radars Friday.After breaking out over downtrend resistance earlier this month, shares have been consolidating in a tight range between $96 and $97.50. Moving out of it now, it faces a big test of $100.Over that mark, and bulls will look to fill the September gap up toward $103, then possibly take shares up to the 200-day moving average.If XLNX can&#39;t break out over $100, see that it holds up near its prior consolidation zone (between $96 and $97.50). Below puts the 50-day moving average on the table, and below that, $90 range support could be next. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to make beautiful move after beautiful move. The latest comes on Friday, as shares break out of a bullish pennant and race to new highs.From here, AMD could kickstart another rally, possibly above $45. The higher it goes, the more traders are going to be pushing for $50.On a pullback, though, see that it finds support from the rising 20-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Below that and the prior high area between $41.79 and $41 needs to support AMD. Otherwise, it may need more time to consolidate.Until then though, let&#39;s try not to get too bearish. The whole market has been strong and being too early to the party -- either bulls on a pullback or bears on a rally -- can result in a nasty burn to the ego and the brokerage account. They say &quot;don&#39;t fight the trend&quot; for a reason.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Newton&#39;s Law of gravity still endures. And next might be positive, but expectations aren&#39;t for blockbuster growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile it&#39;s great to have strong growth stocks, it&#39;s also important to get some income in the mix. Usually these stocks are based in solid sectors that reflect a strong U.S. economy and deliver inflation-beating dividends, so that you can reinvest … or simply pocket the cash.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd I&#39;ve run my Portfolio Grader screens, and these seven top-tier dividend stocks for 2020 are all A-rated winners, that are perfect fits in anyone&#39;s portfolio. Dividend Stocks: The Carlyle Group (CG)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 4.3%The Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG) was set up in 1987, almost as a private equity firm for Washington, D.C. political veterans and their families. One of the more famous names is the Bush family.But those legacy political families also brought along other legacy political families from around the world.It was firm that would manage their money using alternative assets like real estate, corporate financing and natural resources. And the clients had a pretty good idea of what was happening in the world to help the company pick investments.Now, it&#39;s a larger business and has much bigger fish in its pond from Wall Street. But it has still maintained its quality, even at an $11 billion market capitalization.This year, the stock is up a whopping 94% and yet it still delivers a 4.3% dividend with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio slightly above 11. Omega Healthcare InvestorsSource: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 6.4%Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on triple net leases in the nursing home and assisted living facility space.The graying of the baby boomers is a significant demographic shift and this industry sector is going to play an enormous part.As a triple net lease operator, OHI leases properties to companies that run the businesses, and Omega isn&#39;t responsible for property taxes, maintenance or insurance. That means it doesn&#39;t have spend a lot of cash to keep these properties going, which helps boost funds from operations.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 While the stock is up 17% in the past year, it delivers a healthy 6.4% dividend. And even if the broader economy slows, this sector will continue its steady growth, because the population is aging and will need more medical services in the coming years. Blackstone Group (BX)Source: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.5%Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) is a massive investment and fund management services company that runs its own private equity funds in various sectors, including real estate and even private real estate investment trusts.It&#39;s the largest alternative asset management firm in the world. What does that mean? Basically, alternative assets are anything that isn&#39;t a stock, bond, commodity or derivative. That means its energy fund is about owning energy properties or land leases where energy companies drill. Its real estate division owns real estate and land that is bundled into a sector (commercial, tech, healthcare) and then shares are sold to hedge funds and high net worth individuals.It has been very good at what it does for three and a half decades. Even with a $66 billion market cap, the stock is up 95% in the past year, yet its trailing P/E ratio is only 24. And it still delivers a 3.5% dividend on top of that, after all the stock gains. Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.1%Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) operates as REIT, and focuses on multi-family apartment communities in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest U.S.Currently, it operates over 100,000 units in more than 300 communities in 17 states. Most of its communities are built for career professionals who are looking for comfort, amenities, style and convenience without having to pay a premium for it.This is a good sector because it is an ideal Gen X and millennial play on the housing market. Given the student debt many carry, and their memories of the housing market crash, renting in a nice community is an attractive idea.Also, until they settle down, being able to move for opportunity is a big part of their lives, and renting is much less a hassle than buying and then having to sell before you leave.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy The stock is up 33% this year and it still has a dividend of 3.1%. It&#39;s a  bit pricey here, but this is a growth sector that will continue to do well even if the broader economy slows. General Mills (GIS)Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.7%General Mills (NYSE:GIS) has been around since 1866, and is one of the top consumer staples companies in the world.Classic American brands like Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Wheaties, Cheerios, Old El Paso, Green Giant and Yoplait are just a handful of examples.A few years back, this sector, especially the big consumer staples companies, had to reimagine themselves for the newer generations of consumers. The old baby boomer brands weren&#39;t drawing the Gen Xers or millennials.It took a while to turn the ship, but GIS is on its way back. It added new, health-conscious brands (like Annie&#39;s and Blue Buffalo) and also moved into Asian and Latino brands to address a changing American demographic.And it&#39;s paying off. The stock is up 37% in the past year, delivers a reliable 3.7% dividend and yet still has a trailing P/E ratio of around 15. What&#39;s more, earlier this week it announced that it beat earnings expectations in fiscal Q2. Southern Company (SO)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.9%Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is the second-largest utility in the U.S. It provides electricity to customers in Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Mississippi. It also has natural gas distribution channels through a number of other states, and significant solar power facilities as well.SO stock has been around since 1945 and is well positioned to grow it business and deliver new solutions to the region&#39;s energy needs.A few years back it attempted to build the first new nuclear power plant in decades, but regulatory issues turned the project into a nightmare. Fortunately, its base of 4.7 million customers and patient state regulators gave it some cushion. But now those days are behind it and SO is doing well with its natural gas business and alternative energy work.  * 7 &#39;Strong Buy&#39; Stocks to Put on Your Wish List The stock is up 40% in the past 12 months, still delivers a nearly 4% dividend and is trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 14. And better yet, its dividend is bomb-proof. Target (TGT)Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2%Target (NYSE:TGT) is big-box retailing royalty, going back all the way to 1902.This pick is all about the U.S. consumer. Well, it&#39;s a little about how Target overcame some pretty significant obstacles in transitioning to new generations of consumers, including grocery offerings and e-commerce.Five years ago, a lot of Old-School businesses were on the cusp of relevancy. You can see that by the fate of many department stores and retailers. Getting management to shift their thinking to new consumer trends was difficult because the model that brought them success was safe.But failing to adapt was even more dangerous. And TGT finally go it. It pivoted and the success is showing up in the stock, as it has brought back consumers, added new lines of products and become more nimble.TGT has a market cap of $65 billion and the stock is up more than 110% in the past year. That is confirmation of its rebirth.Its dividend may only be 2% at this point, but given that GDP is running about the same level, it&#39;s worth it since this long-term holding will deliver growth and income for a long time to come at this point.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation. Louis Navellier may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

And the clients had a pretty good idea of what was happening in the world to help the company pick investments.Now, it&#39;s a larger business and has much bigger fish in its pond from Wall Street. But it has still maintained its quality, even at an $11 billion market capitalization.This year, the stock is up a whopping 94% and yet it still delivers a 4.3% dividend with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio slightly above 11. Omega Healthcare InvestorsSource: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 6.4%Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on triple net leases in the nursing home and assisted living facility space.The graying of the baby boomers is a significant demographic shift and this industry sector is going to play an enormous part.As a triple net lease operator, OHI leases properties to companies that run the businesses, and Omega isn&#39;t responsible for property taxes, maintenance or insurance. That means it doesn&#39;t have spend a lot of cash to keep these properties going, which helps boost funds from operations.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 While the stock is up 17% in the past year, it delivers a healthy 6.4% dividend. And even if the broader economy slows, this sector will continue its steady growth, because the population is aging and will need more medical services in the coming years. Blackstone Group (BX)Source: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.5%Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) is a massive investment and fund management services company that runs its own private equity funds in various sectors, including real estate and even private real estate investment trusts.It&#39;s the largest alternative asset management firm in the world. What does that mean? Basically, alternative assets are anything that isn&#39;t a stock, bond, commodity or derivative. That means its energy fund is about owning energy properties or land leases where energy companies drill. Its real estate division owns real estate and land that is bundled into a sector (commercial, tech, healthcare) and then shares are sold to hedge funds and high net worth individuals.It has been very good at what it does for three and a half decades. Even with a $66 billion market cap, the stock is up 95% in the past year, yet its trailing P/E ratio is only 24. And it still delivers a 3.5% dividend on top of that, after all the stock gains. Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.1%Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) operates as REIT, and focuses on multi-family apartment communities in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest U.S.Currently, it operates over 100,000 units in more than 300 communities in 17 states. Most of its communities are built for career professionals who are looking for comfort, amenities, style and convenience without having to pay a premium for it.This is a good sector because it is an ideal Gen X and millennial play on the housing market. Given the student debt many carry, and their memories of the housing market crash, renting in a nice community is an attractive idea.Also, until they settle down, being able to move for opportunity is a big part of their lives, and renting is much less a hassle than buying and then having to sell before you leave.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy The stock is up 33% this year and it still has a dividend of 3.1%. It&#39;s a  bit pricey here, but this is a growth sector that will continue to do well even if the broader economy slows. General Mills (GIS)Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.7%General Mills (NYSE:GIS) has been around since 1866, and is one of the top consumer staples companies in the world.Classic American brands like Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Wheaties, Cheerios, Old El Paso, Green Giant and Yoplait are just a handful of examples.A few years back, this sector, especially the big consumer staples companies, had to reimagine themselves for the newer generations of consumers. The old baby boomer brands weren&#39;t drawing the Gen Xers or millennials.It took a while to turn the ship, but GIS is on its way back. It added new, health-conscious brands (like Annie&#39;s and Blue Buffalo) and also moved into Asian and Latino brands to address a changing American demographic.And it&#39;s paying off. The stock is up 37% in the past year, delivers a reliable 3.7% dividend and yet still has a trailing P/E ratio of around 15. What&#39;s more, earlier this week it announced that it beat earnings expectations in fiscal Q2. Southern Company (SO)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.9%Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is the second-largest utility in the U.S. It provides electricity to customers in Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Mississippi. It also has natural gas distribution channels through a number of other states, and significant solar power facilities as well.SO stock has been around since 1945 and is well positioned to grow it business and deliver new solutions to the region&#39;s energy needs.A few years back it attempted to build the first new nuclear power plant in decades, but regulatory issues turned the project into a nightmare. Fortunately, its base of 4.7 million customers and patient state regulators gave it some cushion. But now those days are behind it and SO is doing well with its natural gas business and alternative energy work.  * 7 &#39;Strong Buy&#39; Stocks to Put on Your Wish List The stock is up 40% in the past 12 months, still delivers a nearly 4% dividend and is trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 14. And better yet, its dividend is bomb-proof. Target (TGT)Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2%Target (NYSE:TGT) is big-box retailing royalty, going back all the way to 1902.This pick is all about the U.S. consumer. Well, it&#39;s a little about how Target overcame some pretty significant obstacles in transitioning to new generations of consumers, including grocery offerings and e-commerce.Five years ago, a lot of Old-School businesses were on the cusp of relevancy. You can see that by the fate of many department stores and retailers. Getting management to shift their thinking to new consumer trends was difficult because the model that brought them success was safe.But failing to adapt was even more dangerous. And TGT finally go it. It pivoted and the success is showing up in the stock, as it has brought back consumers, added new lines of products and become more nimble.TGT has a market cap of $65 billion and the stock is up more than 110% in the past year. That is confirmation of its rebirth.Its dividend may only be 2% at this point, but given that GDP is running about the same level, it&#39;s worth it since this long-term holding will deliver growth and income for a long time to come at this point.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation.

One analyst, Nathan Weinstein, at Aegis believes the drug could hit $2 billion in sales by 2025. His peak price target was $23 per share.The problem is Amarin stock is already very close to that target price, at $21.36 per share. In other words, a lot of the good news is already implied in the valuation of AMRN stock. Another analyst, at Stifel, has put a hold recommendation on Amarin stock. His price target is $28 per share.  * 7 &#39;Strong Buy&#39; Stocks to Put on Your Wish List Amarin announced that it expects its 2020 U.S. sales to be between $650 million to $700 million from sales of Vascepa. Seeking Alpha&#39;s database of eight analysts have an average estimate of $692 million in revenue for 2020.That puts Amarin stock on a forward price-to-sales ratio of 11.9 times. That is an extremely high valuation metric. It would normally be the number for a conservative stock&#39;s price-to-earnings ratio.It implies that a bidder for all of AMRN stock would have to wait almost 12 years before their investment would equal the sales achieved, not earnings. Not too many companies would be willing to do that.Clearly the market expects that sales will climb significantly over the next 12 years. There are tw0 problems with that theory: competition and patent issues.

The analysts considered these companies competitive threats to Amarin and its Vascepa drug.In addition, Amarin is facing patent lawsuits from several companies. These include Dr. Reddy&#39;s Laboratories (NYSE:RDY), an Indian pharmaceutical company, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (OTCMKTS:HKMPY), a generic pharma company. However, bullish analysts point out that Teva (NYSE:TEVA) has already settled with Amarin.Most of these suits, including one that begins in January, concern the validity of the core of Amarin&#39;s patent family.

They are essentially a mild form of gambling, although some risks can be minimalized with probability analysis.Given that a prior panel recommended for Vascepa, the AMRN stock price already discounted last week&#39;s FDA good news. Analysts seem to agree. Their target values are not significantly higher than the present price.Investors should look for an opportune time to jump in.

The last time this occurred was June 2007. Based on history, stock performance is mixed after a yield curve inversion but this asset class tends to remain positive for about 18 months. Counting from August 2019, that makes January 2021 a possible beginning for the next downturn.  * Weaker Leading Economic Indicators: In the second half of 2019, key economic indicators showed that the U.S. economic growth rate declined for the first time since May 2016. There are 10 components included among the key leading economic indicators, such as manufacturers new orders, building permits and consumer expectations.  * Declining U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The first three quarters of 2019 showed declining GDP. The Conference Board&#39;s December 11, 2019 update showed expectations for growth to remain the same or slightly higher (up to 2%) in Q4. The expectation is for GDP to hover around 2% in 2020.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever In summary, it&#39;s wise for investors to expect, at best, a continuation of slow growth but no acceleration in 2020. At worst, investors should expect declining GDP throughout the year, nearing recession by Q1 2021. With that backdrop, and in no particular order, here are seven of the best Vanguard ETFs to buy in 2020: Best Vanguard ETFs for 2020: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)Expenses: 0.03%, or $3 annually for every $10,000 investedIf you want to build around a core holding that could be a smart bet in 2020, and in the long run, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) is arguably the best ETF to do the job.Picking the best sectors for 2020 could prove to be challenging because of uncertainties over trade and the presidential election. Because of this, an ETF like VOO, which is diversified across all sectors, can be a wise choice for the foreseeable future.Being cap-weighted, shareholders of VOO will naturally get more exposure to mega-caps like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). But having additional exposure to roughly 500 U.S. large-cap stocks will add to VOO&#39;s appeal in 2020. Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT)Expenses: 0.10%After lagging the S&P 500 in 2019, health sector funds like Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSEARCA:VHT) may be due for a comeback in 2020.The primary drag on performance for health stocks in 2019 was the fear and uncertainty over the Medicare-for-All idea promoted by Democratic presidential nominees, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. By the end of 2019, the fear began to fade and price declines for healthcare stocks appeared to be overdone. Combine this oversold status with their defensive qualities in the face of a potential slowing economy, health sector funds look attractive in 2020.  * 7 Momentum Stocks Refusing to Slow Down To get broad exposure to the healthcare industry, ETFs like VHT are smart plays. VHT&#39;s multi-cap exposure means top holdings are large health stock names like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). But investors also get exposure to small- and mid-cap health stocks. Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC)Expenses: 0.10%Investors expecting a slowing economy in 2020 may like what they see in Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC).Although economic recession does not appear likely in 2020, it&#39;s also unlikely the economy will expand, especially in the absence of further rate cuts from the Fed or fiscal stimulus from new legislation.When the economy is moderating or slowing, consumers tend to become more selective in their buying habits. While they may buy less non-essential items, such as automobiles, apparel and entertainment, consumers will continue to buy the necessary consumer staples, such as food, beverages and household goods.To take advantage of potential strength in the consumer staples sector, investors can gravitate toward equities like VDC top holdings Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM)Expenses: 0.06%There&#39;s no question that the U.S. economy is in the mature phase of the business cycle, which can be a favorable environment for funds like Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM).Investments that tend to perform well in the mature phase of the business cycle include dividend paying stocks, such as VYM top holdings JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), JNJ and PG. In a year that may bring the economy to the edge of recession, high value, high-yielding stocks like these can bring a combination of growth and relatively stability your portfolio needs.  * 7 Ideal Mid-Cap Stocks for a Diverse Portfolio Since VYM tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, shareholders will get exposure to more than 400 U.S. dividend paying stocks. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)Expenses: 0.06%The best dividend funds to buy for both 2020 and the long term are arguably those that hold stocks of companies that consistently increase their dividends. To get broad exposure to these stocks, investors can buy Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG).Although Vanguard ETFs that provide high yields can be smart plays now, funds like VIG can be smarter, especially if you&#39;re looking for a combination of short-term and long-term benefit. In the short term, meaning the year 2020, value-oriented stocks that pay dividends are wise additions to a portfolio. For the long run, holding stocks that increase their dividends is also a wise move.VYM tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Index, which emphasizes large U.S. stocks that have a record of growing dividends year over year. Therefore shareholders get access to dividend stocks like MSFT, PG and WMT. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO)Expenses: 0.12%Having been in an extended slump, which was aggravated by trade tensions in 2019, funds like Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:VWO) could see a comeback in 2020.VWO tracks the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index, which means that shareholders get a diversified mix of large-, mid- and small-cap stocks of companies located in emerging markets all around the world. Top five countries, from highest to lowest allocation percentage, are China, Taiwan, India, Brazil and South Africa.  * 10 2019 Losers That Will Be 2020 Winners The underlying index is cap-weighted, which means the holdings are less geared toward mid- and small-caps and more concentrated in large-cap emerging market stocks like Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)Expenses: 0.035%Bonds aren&#39;t expected to beat stocks in 2020, but the best bond fund to hold will likely be Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (NYSEARCA:BND).The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that it will not move on rates in 2020. The monetary policy impact on bond prices will not be significantly positive or negative, but investors are wise to expect a below-average year for fixed income. At the same time, monetary policy has not exactly been predictable over the past year.Because of the potential for a lackluster year for bonds, combined with uncertainty in the direction of rates, investors are wise to stick with a broadly diversified bond fund with extremely low expenses like BND. Since the fund tracks the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, shareholders are essentially holding the entire U.S. bond market.As of this writing, Kent Thune did not personally hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The last time this occurred was June 2007. Based on history, stock performance is mixed after a yield curve inversion but this asset class tends to remain positive for about 18 months. Counting from August 2019, that makes January 2021 a possible beginning for the next downturn.  * Weaker Leading Economic Indicators: In the second half of 2019, key economic indicators showed that the U.S. economic growth rate declined for the first time since May 2016. There are 10 components included among the key leading economic indicators, such as manufacturers new orders, building permits and consumer expectations.  * Declining U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The first three quarters of 2019 showed declining GDP. The Conference Board&#39;s December 11, 2019 update showed expectations for growth to remain the same or slightly higher (up to 2%) in Q4. The expectation is for GDP to hover around 2% in 2020.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever In summary, it&#39;s wise for investors to expect, at best, a continuation of slow growth but no acceleration in 2020. At worst, investors should expect declining GDP throughout the year, nearing recession by Q1 2021. With that backdrop, and in no particular order, here are seven of the best Vanguard ETFs to buy in 2020: Best Vanguard ETFs for 2020: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)Expenses: 0.03%, or $3 annually for every $10,000 investedIf you want to build around a core holding that could be a smart bet in 2020, and in the long run, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) is arguably the best ETF to do the job.Picking the best sectors for 2020 could prove to be challenging because of uncertainties over trade and the presidential election. Because of this, an ETF like VOO, which is diversified across all sectors, can be a wise choice for the foreseeable future.Being cap-weighted, shareholders of VOO will naturally get more exposure to mega-caps like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). But having additional exposure to roughly 500 U.S. large-cap stocks will add to VOO&#39;s appeal in 2020. Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT)Expenses: 0.10%After lagging the S&P 500 in 2019, health sector funds like Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSEARCA:VHT) may be due for a comeback in 2020.The primary drag on performance for health stocks in 2019 was the fear and uncertainty over the Medicare-for-All idea promoted by Democratic presidential nominees, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. By the end of 2019, the fear began to fade and price declines for healthcare stocks appeared to be overdone. Combine this oversold status with their defensive qualities in the face of a potential slowing economy, health sector funds look attractive in 2020.  * 7 Momentum Stocks Refusing to Slow Down To get broad exposure to the healthcare industry, ETFs like VHT are smart plays. VHT&#39;s multi-cap exposure means top holdings are large health stock names like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). But investors also get exposure to small- and mid-cap health stocks. Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC)Expenses: 0.10%Investors expecting a slowing economy in 2020 may like what they see in Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC).Although economic recession does not appear likely in 2020, it&#39;s also unlikely the economy will expand, especially in the absence of further rate cuts from the Fed or fiscal stimulus from new legislation.When the economy is moderating or slowing, consumers tend to become more selective in their buying habits. While they may buy less non-essential items, such as automobiles, apparel and entertainment, consumers will continue to buy the necessary consumer staples, such as food, beverages and household goods.To take advantage of potential strength in the consumer staples sector, investors can gravitate toward equities like VDC top holdings Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM)Expenses: 0.06%There&#39;s no question that the U.S. economy is in the mature phase of the business cycle, which can be a favorable environment for funds like Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM).Investments that tend to perform well in the mature phase of the business cycle include dividend paying stocks, such as VYM top holdings JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), JNJ and PG. In a year that may bring the economy to the edge of recession, high value, high-yielding stocks like these can bring a combination of growth and relatively stability your portfolio needs.  * 7 Ideal Mid-Cap Stocks for a Diverse Portfolio Since VYM tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, shareholders will get exposure to more than 400 U.S. dividend paying stocks. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)Expenses: 0.06%The best dividend funds to buy for both 2020 and the long term are arguably those that hold stocks of companies that consistently increase their dividends. To get broad exposure to these stocks, investors can buy Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG).Although Vanguard ETFs that provide high yields can be smart plays now, funds like VIG can be smarter, especially if you&#39;re looking for a combination of short-term and long-term benefit. In the short term, meaning the year 2020, value-oriented stocks that pay dividends are wise additions to a portfolio. For the long run, holding stocks that increase their dividends is also a wise move.VYM tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Index, which emphasizes large U.S. stocks that have a record of growing dividends year over year. Therefore shareholders get access to dividend stocks like MSFT, PG and WMT. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO)Expenses: 0.12%Having been in an extended slump, which was aggravated by trade tensions in 2019, funds like Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:VWO) could see a comeback in 2020.VWO tracks the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index, which means that shareholders get a diversified mix of large-, mid- and small-cap stocks of companies located in emerging markets all around the world. Top five countries, from highest to lowest allocation percentage, are China, Taiwan, India, Brazil and South Africa.  * 10 2019 Losers That Will Be 2020 Winners The underlying index is cap-weighted, which means the holdings are less geared toward mid- and small-caps and more concentrated in large-cap emerging market stocks like Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)Expenses: 0.035%Bonds aren&#39;t expected to beat stocks in 2020, but the best bond fund to hold will likely be Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (NYSEARCA:BND).The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that it will not move on rates in 2020.

Ironically, as technology advances, so will demand for the physical facilitation of those innovations. But over the past few years, this concept generally hasn&#39;t worked well for companies like Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). During the trailing five-year period, FCX stock has dropped 44%.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com Why? Mostly, the commodities sector, particularly precious metals like gold and silver, peaked early this decade. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the physical assets market higher, only to be met with biting disappointment. Of course, that didn&#39;t suit Freeport-McMoRan stock well. The underlying company specializes in the industrial metals copper and molybdenum. It also has exposure to the gold market.Frankly, FCX stock was on track to be a disappointment this year as well. Up until late October, shares were down compared to January&#39;s opening price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, Freeport-McMoRan stock experienced a dramatic resurgence the day after Halloween. Since the unofficial holiday, shares have jumped 33%.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade Naturally, with such a strong spike, investors question if enough momentum remains for 2020 and beyond. If that&#39;s you, all I can say is, oh yeah! FCX stock is primed to rock and roll. Here are three reasons why: The Federal Reserve&#39;s Dovish StanceAmong the many people not on President Donald Trump&#39;s Christmas card list is probably Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Routinely, Trump has bitterly complained that Powell refuses to aggressively cut benchmark interest rates. Just in that context, that might not appear beneficial for Freeport-McMoRan stock.But the reality is that the Fed has been more than accommodating for the administration and the broader economy. Powell has several times noted that he and his team of central bankers will monitor economic conditions and act accordingly.Irrespective of executive pressure, Powell is doing the right thing, applying a balanced, rational but nevertheless dovish strategy. And the best news of all came recently. According to the Washington Post, Powell sees no need to raise interest rates anytime soon.It&#39;s not what Trump wanted. However, it&#39;s good news for him, the economy and FCX stock. At the end of the day, the Fed is still accommodative. Naturally, this provides inflationary upside for commodities, something that Freeport-McMoRan hasn&#39;t seen for some time. Copper Prices Will (Finally) Support FCX StockAs I briefly mentioned up top, Freeport-McMoRan is a major player in the copper market. Barring extremely unusual circumstances, high copper prices (demand) is always good for FCX stock.If you need math to convince you, consider this: from January 1995 to through November 2019, the correlation coefficient between Freeport-McMoRan and the copper price per metric ton stands at a whopping 88%. In other words, as copper demand goes, so too does FCX.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto And that&#39;s very good news for stakeholders and prospective buyers, according to Capital Economics&#39; commodities expert Ross Strachan. He wrote:Constrained supply growth and surging demand from electric vehicles mean that we think that the price of copper will rise by over 60%, to nearly $10,000 per tonne, by 2025 … This rally is almost three times higher than consensus estimates.Perhaps surprisingly to many readers, &quot;green&quot; technologies use substantial amounts of copper. Strachan notes that this is especially the case for &quot;electric vehicles, which use a lot more copper than cars with internal combustion engines.&quot;But copper has conductivity and other vital attributes that are critical for most industries. Furthermore, as developing nations transition to developed status, copper (and other metal) demand will surely increase.That&#39;s positive for copper prices and therefore Freeport-McMoRan stock. Golden Bonus for Freeport-McMoRan StockAlthough the industrial metals are where FCX stock makes its most money, Freeport-McMoRan is nevertheless an important gold player. While gold has been a temptress - skyrocketing in the summer but shedding momentum in the fall - I believe this market will also turn around.Again, consider the Fed&#39;s dovish policy. While it doesn&#39;t meet the aggression standards of Trump and his goldbug followers, it&#39;s still aggressive enough. Apparently, we are going to get our inflation: the bickering is over the magnitude.Beyond monetary policy, I think investors are anxiously eyeing both U.S. politics and geopolitics. Like gold, a meaningful resolution to the U.S.-China trade war has seductively eluded investors until just recently. But even then, things can go from great to terrible in a blink of an eye under this administration.If any fissures develop, gold is back on the upswing. And I believe that the uncertainties of the 2020 election will help boost the precious metal. Either way, I think you&#39;re looking at a positive, inflationary environment for Freeport-McMoRan stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold and silver bullion. He is also considering a long position in FCX stock in the next 72 hours.

Now trading just under $2.30 per share, it trades close to its 52-week low. As losses mount and a cash crunch looms, conditions will probably get worse before they get better.Source: Shutterstock Despite its problems, the company has viable options to raise cash. Moreover, if its medical business continues to grow, I see an eventual recovery for Aurora after its blood in the greenhouse moment. The Troubles Continue for AuroraIn early November, I told Aurora Cannabis investors to brace for more declines and eventually a reverse split. I pointed out that the hype in marijuana stocks may continue to fade. I also warned that Aurora stock could face a reverse split.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince I made that call, it has lost nearly 40% of its value in a six-week time span. It also trades for less than $2.30 per share. Once it falls below $1 per share, the New York Stock Exchange will require a reverse split if it wants to continue trading on the exchange.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 Unfortunately for Aurora Cannabis, little has changed for the company other than the stock price. Moreover, strategic errors from the past continue to haunt the company.For one, it did not ally with a large alcohol or tobacco company comparable to the Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) investment in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). Also, it went all-in on production capacity. Though it became the world&#39;s largest marijuana producer, this does not help Aurora when the market faces a massive oversupply of dried cannabis.Furthermore, it does not earn profits like Aphria (NYSE:APHA), which made the same bet on production capacity. It has instead depended on massive dilution. As late as June 2017, only about 27.9 million shares of Aurora traded. Today, that number is 1.05 billion.Aurora Cannabis currently holds about 191.93 million CAD ($146.32 million) in cash. This will only keep the company afloat for two more quarters. However, It Can Avoid BankruptcyDespite the bleak outlook, I do see a scenario where it can at least keep its doors open. For now, more debt issuance is probably an option. It currently holds over 395.15 million CAD ($301.25 million) in long-term debt against 4.39 billion CAD ($3.34 billion) in equity.Furthermore, despite its pain, Wall Street believes the company will grow its revenues by 63% in the current 2020 fiscal year and by 86.3% in 2021. This gives creditors a reason to believe it can help the company through its cash crunch and get paid back in full at a later time.Aurora Cannabis could also sell off some of its production capacity. Still, with the market&#39;s massive supply glut, these assets will likely sell at a discounted price. Also, Vince Martin stated that its medical cannabis business serves close to 90,000 patients across the world. This could help Aurora as medical marijuana laws are permissive in comparison to those for recreational weed.In the meantime, it will have to raise more cash. Hence, I still think we will see the share price below $1 per share, prompting a reverse split for Aurora. Because I see no reason why investors should stick around for this pain, I would recommend they get out for now. The Bottom Line on Aurora CannabisAurora Cannabis can recover, but not before we see blood in its greenhouses. Currently, the company holds enough cash to stay in business for only about two more quarters. Moreover, between massive dilution and its low share price, a reverse split for the company appears likely.However, unlike most reverse splits, I do not think this one would necessarily turn into a precursor to bankruptcy. Thanks to low debt levels, it can probably find the capital to stay afloat.Moreover, tremendous revenue growth and a robust medical cannabis business can serve the company well. Furthermore, despite the current supply glut, massive revenue growth and the liberalizing of marijuana laws across the world could make its production volumes an asset instead of a liability.Still, this point for Aurora Cannabis will only come after a significant amount of further pain. Until it falls much further and executes a reverse split, I see little reason to hold this stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.
