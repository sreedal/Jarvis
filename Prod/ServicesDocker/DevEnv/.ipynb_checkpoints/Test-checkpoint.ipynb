Her firm’s 100 outlets have been closed for about a month because of the coronavirus, cash reserves are dwindling and banks are reluctant to extend deadlines on billions of yuan in debt coming due over the next few months. There are also other creditors to think about.“If we can’t pay back the bonds, it will be very, very bad,” said Brigita, whose company has 10,000 employees and sells mid- to high-end car brands such as BMWs. She asked that only her first name be used and that her firm not be identified because she isn’t authorized to speak to the press.With much of China’s economy still idled as authorities try to contain an epidemic that has infected more than 75,000 people, millions of companies across the country are in a race against the clock to stay afloat.A survey of small- and medium-sized Chinese companies conducted this month showed that a third of respondents only had enough cash to cover fixed expenses for a month, with another third running out within two months.While China’s government has cut interest rates, ordered banks to boost lending and loosened criteria for companies to restart operations, many of the nation’s private businesses say they’ve been unable to access the funding they need to meet upcoming deadlines for debt and salary payments. Without more financial support or a sudden rebound in China’s economy, some may have to shut for good.“If China fails to contain the virus in the first quarter, I expect a vast number of small businesses would go under,” said Lv Changshun, an analyst at Beijing Zhonghe Yingtai Management Consultant Co.Despite accounting for 60% of the economy and 80% of jobs in China, private businesses have long struggled to tap funding to help them expand during booms and survive crises.President Xi Jinping over the weekend pledged a greater focus on reviving the economy, with a more proactive fiscal policy, accelerated construction projects and freer reserves for commercial lenders to unleash more funding.Support from China’s banking giants in response to the outbreak has so far been piecemeal, mostly earmarked for directly combating the virus. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s largest lender, has offered relief to about 5% of its small business clients.In an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg News, ICBC said it has allocated 5.4 billion yuan ($770 million) to help companies fight the virus. “We approve qualified small businesses’ loan applications as soon as they arrive,” the bank said.As a group, Chinese banks had offered about 794 billion yuan in loans related to the containment effort as of Feb. 20, according to the banking industry association, with foreign lenders such as Citigroup Inc. also lowering rates. To put that into perspective, China’s small businesses typically face interest payments on about 36.9 trillion yuan of loans every quarter.Stringent requirements and shortlists restrict who can access special loans earmarked by the central bank for virus-related businesses, while local governments and banks have imposed caps on the amounts, according to people familiar with the matter. A debt banker at one of China’s largest brokerages said his firm opened a fast lane to ease debt sales by businesses involved in the containment effort, with borrowers required to prove they will use at least 10% of the proceeds to fight the disease.That’s of little help to a car dealership. Brigita, whose firm owes money to dozens of banks, said she has so far only reached an agreement with a handful to extend payment deadlines by two months. For now, the company is still paying salaries.Many of China’s businesses were already grasping for lifelines before the virus hit, pummeled by a trade war and lending crackdown that sent economic growth to a three-decade low last year.At most risk are the labor-intensive catering and restaurant industries, travel agencies, airlines, hotels and shopping malls, according to Lianhe Rating.Yang, a property manager of a seven-story mall in Shanghai, says a tenant who runs a 150-room hotel that’s usually busy has called asking for a month’s rent waiver after business dried up. She expects the massage parlor that rents space in the mall is also struggling and is open to extending some help.A deputy financing director at a small developer in central Anhui province said his firm is even being denied loans under existing credit lines. A drop in sales has hurt the company’s credit profile and a dearth of new projects means there’s no collateral to put up. Without access to credit, the business can survive for about four months, or maybe longer if some payments can be delayed, he said.Banks are hardly any better off themselves. Many are under-capitalized and on the ropes after two years of record debt defaults. Rating firm S&P Global has estimated that a prolonged emergency could cause the banking system’s bad loan ratio to more than triple to about 6.3%, amounting to an increase of 5.6 trillion yuan.Wu Hai, owner of Mei KTV, a chain of 100 Karaoke bars across China, took to the nation’s premier outlet of discontent, social media platform WeChat, to voice his despair.KTV’s bars have been closed by the government because of the virus, choking off its cash flow. The special loans from the authorities will be of little help and no bank will provide a loan without enough collateral and cash flow, he said on his official WeChat account earlier this month.Wu couldn’t be reached for a direct comment, but on WeChat he gave himself two months before he has to shutter his business.(Adds details on economic measures in eighth paragraph, updates lending in 10th.)&#92;--With assistance from Jun Luo, Emma Dong and Yinan Zhao.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Evelyn Yu in Shanghai at yyu263@bloomberg.net;Ken Wang in Beijing at ywang1690@bloomberg.net;Zheng Li in Shanghai at zli698@bloomberg.net;Xize Kang in Beijing at xkang7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, Jonas Bergman, Michael PattersonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

Chinese businesses like Alibaba and Meituan with outsized footprints in the material world are rushing to contain the fallout while virtual denizens ByteDance Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. ride a surge in social media and entertainment.It boils down to the difference between hawking analog and digital wares. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan Dianping have shed $28 billion of market value since Covid-19 erupted in central China in January because they depend on millions of people and trucks to ferry packages and meals through an increasingly tangled nationwide transport network. WeChat operator Tencent, which flogs virtual goods like costumes and armor in mobile games or sprinkles advertising online, has gained about $18 billion. Its market value now hovers around half a trillion dollars.More than any other company, Alibaba’s fate is intertwined with that of the world’s No. 2 economy. Its caution on Feb. 13 about weakening earnings exposed just how much China’s most valuable company depends on old-fashioned elbow grease in delivery, manufacturing and logistics. The e-commerce giant warned of a “significant” hit this quarter because the people who take orders, fabricate products and then ship them to doorsteps can’t get to their jobs. It’s a reminder of how much the fortunes of China’s tech giants hinge on unglamorous, analog tasks -- at their peak, Alibaba’s partners deliver upwards of a billion packages a day.“We just have fewer delivery people now because my co-workers couldn’t get back to work,” said a courier for Alibaba partner SF Express who would only give his surname as Qiu before dashing off. “Those of us still working are assigned more packages. Good thing I got a break during the Spring Festival,” he said, referring to the Lunar New Year holidays.Read more Alibaba Warns Virus Having Broad Impact on Chinese EconomyRead more: Chinese Abandon Food Delivery Fearing Drivers Will Spread VirusChina’s corporations are struggling to cope with the coronavirus outbreak to varying degrees. Some such as Tencent and TikTok-owner ByteDance are benefiting from a vastly increased audience as millions are confined to their homes, with mobile gaming and livestreaming their only recourse to entertainment. Tencent, which reports earnings in March, is expected to unveil a surge in time spent on games such as Honor of Kings and growth on WeChat. For now, analysts are projecting its fastest pace of sales growth since 2018 in both the December and March quarters.But few in tech offer as broad a glimpse into business under the epidemic than Alibaba. The company initially benefited from a surge in online shopping from millions confined by the largest work-from-home undertaking in history. Yet, it turns out, a lot of the millions of packages that get delivered every day are cheap items such as groceries and face masks. Consumers are eschewing pricier merchandise given growing fears that the eventual hit to the Chinese economy could be far worse than expected.“Logistics is probably the biggest bottleneck right now, but it is improving. However, it is not the only bottleneck,” said Jerry Liu, a Hong Kong-based analyst with UBS who expects things to get back to normal only around the second half. “We do assume weaker demand for e-commerce platforms even if online penetration is higher in recent weeks. Based on our checks, a part of that is due to less spending on things that are not urgent, such as apparel or electronics, versus outbreak prevention items or food.”Read more: How Fast Can China’s Economy Bounce Back from Virus LockdownAlibaba’s got other problems too -- like discontent in the ranks. Hangzhou, its home, is a city under self-imposed siege. Just an hour from Shanghai, the city famed for its scenic lake has imposed some of the harshest quarantine and coronavirus-prevention measures outside of the outbreak’s epicenter. Into its third week, the clampdown is posing unusual challenges to tens of thousands of employees that chieftain Jack Ma proudly proclaimed only last year were more than willing to go the extra mile.For one employee, the ordeal began weeks ago. Local officials barred the Alibaba staffer from returning to her own rental apartment for days because she was from out-of-town. She lived and worked from a colleague’s apartment, sending a selfie to her boss every morning to prove she was logged on and raring to go. She’s only allowed to leave her temporary quarters once every three days.“There’s no such thing as counting overtime hours at Alibaba,” said the 27-year-old who goes by Lilac but wouldn’t allow the use of her last name for fear of reprisal. “You have to check messages on DingTalk whenever it rings.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s sales may contract in its core China retail marketplaces and local services business in the coming quarter even if the coronavirus outbreak subsides, as logistic and production disruptions faced by merchants could take time to resolve.&#92;- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Read more: ‘Nightmare’ for Global Tech: Virus Fallout Is Just Beginning An Alibaba spokesperson said the company was helping merchants cope.

As Wall Street observers gauge the strength of a particular investment opportunity, often, they will filter out the noise and instead, concentrate their attention on its long-term growth prospects. We are referring to whether or not a name can achieve sustainable growth over the long haul, handsomely rewarding investors in the years to come.So, with this goal in mind, what’s the first step for investors ready to get down to business? It’s narrowing down the multitude of tickers traded in the public market to a select few that represent the pick of the bunch. To make it into this exclusive group, these names should not only have strong long-term growth narratives, but also the analyst community’s support.Setting out on our own search, we used TipRanks’ Stock Screener tool to pinpoint 3 stocks that have earned “Strong Buy” consensus ratings from the analysts and boast substantial upside potential from current levels.Let’s get started.Selecta Biosciences (SELB)Selecta Biosciences believes that its ImmTOR immune tolerance platform can help patients fight rare diseases. Currently, biologic drugs can trigger neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that work against the therapy, but ImmTOR technology allows for immune tolerance of the therapy. With this biotech already having gained 107% over the last twelve months, investors want to know if there’s more fuel left in the tank.According to Mizuho Securities analyst Difei Yang, the answer is yes. She highlights the COMPARE trial as being the driving force behind her bullish thesis. The Phase 2 clinical trial is evaluating its lead candidate, SEL-212, in patients with chronic refractory gout, specifically looking at its efficacy in resolving symptoms like flares and gouty arthritis. Based on earlier clinical data, a combined therapy of ImmTOR and pegadricase, the current uricase therapy approved by the FDA, was able to reduce the occurrence of gout flares. As a result, the data allowed SEL-212 to proceed to a head-to-head COMPARE trial, the enrollment of which was completed back in December.Yang argues that the “encouraging” interim data increases the therapy’s likelihood of FDA approval. When looking at the big picture, she is optimistic about the platform as it may lead to a re-dosing of gene therapy. Additionally, she points out that the company was able to cut its financing overhang.Given Yang’s high hopes for SELB, it makes sense that she stayed with the bulls. Not only did she maintain a Buy rating, but she also bumped up the price target from $4 to $7. This new target conveys her confidence in the biotech’s ability to climb 66% higher over the next year. (To watch Yang’s track record, click here)What does the rest of the Street have to say? As it turns out, when it comes to SELB, other analysts are also on board. With 5 Buy ratings assigned in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells, the word on the Street is that the stock is a Strong Buy. Not to mention the $8.67 average price target puts the potential twelve-month gain at 105%. (See Selecta stock analysis on TipRanks) Ocular Therapeutix (OCUL)This biopharma uses a hydrogel platform to develop innovative treatments for various eye diseases. While its DEXTENZA insert has received FDA approval for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery, analysts point to its development pipeline as being capable of driving further growth on top of its already posted 57% one-year rise.On February 7, the company released data from the Phase 1 clinical trial for its OTX-TIC candidate at the Glaucoma 360 conference in San Francisco. The trial is studying the long acting travoprost intracameral implant’s ability to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.The data readout was a major positive for the company, as the candidate was not only able to lower IOP levels very fast, but it also sustained these reduced levels for significant periods of time, 18 months in one case. Adding to the good news, OTX-TIC was found to be well tolerated and safe, with no serious adverse events reported. It should also be noted that OCUL has kicked off the third and fourth cohort enrollment for the Phase 1 trial, and it will continue to monitor the first two cohorts long-term.This trial outcome has certainly impressed Wall Street analysts, namely Yi Chen of H.C. Wainwright. Thanks to the positive data announced so far, the five-star analyst argues that the candidate is more likely to receive approval from the FDA, increasing the pobability from 20% to 30%. To this end, Chen boosted the price target by $2 in addition to reiterating his Buy recommendation. At $8, the new target implies that shares could surge 42% over the next year. (To watch Chen’s track record, click here)Like the H.C. Wainwright analyst, Piper Sandler’s Joseph Catanzaro believes that the data was promising enough to warrant a price target increase. Along with his Overweight rating, the four-star analyst lifted the price target from $5.50 to $7. (To watch Catanzaro’s track record, click here)When looking at other analyst activity, it has been relatively quiet as only one other analyst has published a recent review. That being said, the call was also bullish, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. Given the $7.33 average price target, a 30% twelve-month gain could be in the cards. (See Ocular Therapeutix stock analysis on TipRanks) Lithia Motors (LAD)Switching gears now, we move on to Lithia Motors, one of the largest car retailers in the U.S. While the name has taken some heat recently, several analysts still see more growth in store for the company, which has already posted a 46% twelve-month gain.In 2019, Lithia became the broadest coast-to-coast car retail network after it expanded its reach to include 92% of the U.S. Currently, the company’s physical network is comprised of 189 stores located across the U.S., with 21 brands of vehicles being represented in California alone.That being said, the auto retailer isn’t finished growing just yet. Last week, Lithia announced that it had acquired two Lexus stores in Sacramento and Roseville, California. According to statements from President and CEO Bryan DeBoer, these two locations could see revenue reach $160 million.Craig-Hallum analyst Ryan Sigdahl doesn’t dispute the fact that the temporary pressure on margins caused him to assume a lower premium to comps. He does remind investors, though, that overall, the company’s most recent quarter was solid. During the quarter, Lithia Motors was able to generate “strong” 7% year-over-year same-store sales growth in a slowing SAAR environment as a result of strength in its used vehicle business. Additionally, the analyst argues that the reason its profits took a hit was its integration of recent acquisitions and its efforts to position itself for a “banner year of growth”.In line with his optimistic approach, Sigdahl tells investors that the recent weakness presents an attractive entry-point. Along with his Buy rating, though, the analyst did reduce the price target from $200 to $170. However, the target still leaves room for a possible twelve-month gain of 31%. (To watch Sigdahl’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, it appears that other Wall Street pros are on the same page. As 100% of the analysts that have issued a recent recommendation see the stock as a Buy, the message is clear: LAD is a Strong Buy. On top of this, the $168 average price target suggests 30% upside potential. (See Lithia Motors stock analysis on TipRanks)<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

But even as Buffett approaches 90, the spotlight-loving chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. isn’t ready just yet to talk about who will run his giant company when he’s gone. He\\xa0still has\\xa0more to say, and more to do —\\xa0and that could make for an interesting year ahead.Buffett’s\\xa0annual letter of intrigue arrived Saturday morning, a roundup of thoughts\\xa0that the Oracle of Omaha has been publishing for six decades. It’s evolved over time into what reads like a\\xa0love letter to shareholders, to\\xa0insurance float —\\xa0the lucrative gift that keeps on giving at Berkshire — and to America as a whole, while taking the occasional jab\\xa0at Wall Street’s fee-giddy bankers and anyone who thinks Ebitda is an honest profit gauge. Lately, he’s also\\xa0lamented the lack of cheap\\xa0takeover targets. The company’s last splashy acquisition was in 2015, when it struck a\\xa0$37 billion deal for airplane-parts supplier Precision Castparts. Berkshire had $128 billion of cash as of December, about the same level as the previous quarter and many billions more than Buffett would like to see sitting in a bank.\\xa0The letter, one of two major yearly events for Berkshire investors and Buffett groupies\\xa0(the other is the shareholder meeting each May)\\xa0has become more condensed in recent years.\\xa0But more important to readers is what’s written\\xa0between the lines — hints of a major deal and signs that the world’s most celebrated businessman is\\xa0about to step aside. I suspect the former will come before the latter, though not even Buffett can truly know.As mentioned, Buffett will turn 90 this summer, and his right-hand man Charlie Munger is 96. His letter contained an anecdote about a\\xa0friend from his past who, at the relatively ripe age of 80-something,\\xa0kept\\xa0receiving requests from a local newspaper for biographical data so that it could prep the man’s obituary. The request\\xa0was marked “URGENT.” “Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone,” Buffett wrote, assuring shareholders that their company is “100% prepared” for the\\xa0sad day of their departure and even sharing some details about his will. In my decade covering Berkshire, it’s the most I can remember Buffett discussing what will happen when he’s gone.Over 12 to 15 years after his death, Buffett’s class A shares will be converted into B shares and distributed to various charities; the executors and trustees are otherwise instructed not to sell any Berkshire stock, no matter what. That’s putting a lot of faith in the next CEO, whoever it is.\\xa0Buffett’s still keeping hush about his succession plans. But\\xa0in a first this year, he said that shareholders can direct questions directly to his lieutenants, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, at the May investor meeting. It’s something I suggested Berkshire should start doing at last year’s meeting, and indeed Buffett did hand Abel the mic in a rather symbolic, if impromptu,\\xa0moment during the Q&A session.\\xa0Not long ago, Abel’s title was\\xa0expanded from head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy to vice chairman of all the company’s various operations —\\xa0except for insurance, which is overseen by Jain.\\xa0Notably, this year’s letter\\xa0signaled a desire to invest more of the energy division’s retained earnings to take on large utility projects. He said Berkshire’s operations in the Omaha-based company’s neighboring state of Iowa will be wind self-sufficient by next year thanks to investments in wind turbines, which have\\xa0helped to keep rates lower than the competition as profits soar. Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF —\\xa0the railroad Berkshire bought in 2009 —\\xa0together earned $8.3 billion last year, making them two of the biggest contributors to profit. Abel’s rising profile, along with the emphasis on energy, leads me to wonder whether he’s not only being groomed to take over for Buffett, but also whether Abel could soon make his own M&A splash.\\xa0Separately, Todd Combs, who manages some of Berkshire&#39;s stock-market portfolio, was recently tapped to be CEO of its Geico insurance business. Despite his dual-function sparking succession curiosity, he didn&#39;t get a shout-out in the letter.Buffett’s letter always includes a rant on the\\xa0topics du jour, and this year’s was corporate governance. He\\xa0penned a section on the\\xa0“vexing problem” of\\xa0subservient corporate boards made up of overpaid aging directors, especially those who don’t tap into their own savings to buy shares in the companies\\xa0they serve. Of course, Berkshire is guilty of some of that. The average age of its board is 74 (including three nonagenarians). Buffett’s celebrity and track record has also allowed him to skirt\\xa0many of the corporate governance customs expected of other CEOs, such as quarterly earnings calls, more detailed filings and returning cash to shareholders. His successor may not be given so much leeway, especially not with $128 billion sitting around.\\xa0Reading that finger-wagging section, it was hard not to think of Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. —\\xa0one company that was once seen as Buffett-investment quality, and another that in many ways tried to be like Berkshire. The downfall of each has been a devastating display of what can happen when leadership isn’t held to account, and I imagine that’s the sort of thing Buffett had in mind when he was writing. Then again, his investment in Kraft Heinz Co. is almost the pot calling the kettle black. Kraft Heinz juiced Ebitda by irresponsibly under-investing\\xa0in its business —\\xa0which goes completely against the Buffett way —\\xa0and all the while it happened under Buffett’s nose. Berkshire is the largest shareholder, and while the Kraft Heinz holding is carried at $13.8 billion on its balance sheet, it had\\xa0a market value of only $10.5 billion as of Dec. 31 (and is worth even less than that now).Buffett only reveals what he wants to, and it’s clear that succession is on his mind, as is his unending hunger for deals.

The S&P 500 rose 29% by year’s end, and the NASDAQ, with its heavy emphasis on tech stocks, performed even better, growing 35% for the year. In a curious demonstration of uneven gains, just two companies – Apple and Microsoft – accounted for 15% of the S&P’s total annual gains.Are the good times over, though? The markets appear to be slowing so far this year, and analysts are predicting only a 3% to 5% gain by the end of 2020. Headwinds are forming, as the coronavirus outbreak impinges on trade and travel patterns in Asia as well as a growing list of other regions. The impact has been particularly felt in the tech sector, where companies generally have more exposure to China.But this doesn’t mean that investors should steer clear of tech. There are still plenty of Buy-rated choices available – if you’re willing to look a little deeper. We’ve used the Stock Screener tool from TipRanks to pull up three such stocks, small-cap companies with upside potential in excess of 20%. Here are the results.Allot, Ltd. (ALLT)We’ll start with Allot, a cloud computing company focused on network intelligence and security solutions. The company’s products include security as a service (SECaaS), DOS protection, and network intelligence and traffic management. Allot is a fast-growing company in the cloud software niche, as shown by the recently reported Q4 2019 results.The company reported Q4 revenue grew 14% year-over-year to reach $30.6 million, with annual revenues of $110.1 million reflecting a 15% increase. Like many small-cap tech companies, Allot reported a net loss per share in the quarter, of 5 cents. This didn’t scare off investors as the stock is up 41% so far this year.Looking ahead, Allot is confident in its ability to drive continued growth. Management reported a bookings backlog worth $138 million – a sign that customer interest remains strong. Projecting the backlog will lend itself to future sales, the company guides for 2020 revenue in the range of $135 million to $140 million.Covering this stock for Needham, 5-star analyst Alex Henderson has given ALLT a Buy rating and a rare double price target increase this month. He initially raised his target from $9.50 to $11.50, but has since lifted it to $15. In total, that’s a 58% increase in his outlook for the stock, and suggests a 26% upside potential. (To watch Henderson’s track record, click here)Supporting his stance, Henderson says, “We… forecast accelerating revenue growth in 2020, and believe that it needs to sustain its pace of subscription wins after the stock nearly doubled over the past 18 months. Allot Communications should succeed given its robust pipeline of leads and the adoption intent of its customers regarding its Security subscription businesses.”As a smaller tech company, with a market cap of $410.5 million, ALLT shares have escaped intense scrutiny from Wall Street’s analysts. The review by Henderson is currently the only one in the TipRanks database – but it does indicate a clear path forward for the stock. (See Allot stock analysis on TipRanks) Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (AKTS)Next on today’s list is Akoustis, a provider of the crystal-based piezoelectric components of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters commonly used in mobile wireless devices, including smartphones. It’s a specialty niche, but a profitable one, and AKTS saw share gains of 61% in 2019.Following up on its fiscal Q1 moves, Akoustis realized over $32 million in net cash from a common stock issuance. The success of the stock sale gives the company a healthy balance sheet moving forward, important as total revenues, while in line with guidance, were flat sequentially. The net loss per share in the quarter was 21 cents, which was less severe than the 24 cents expected. AKTS shares are up 12% since the earnings release.Sujeeva De Silva, 5-star analyst with Roth Capital, is bullish on AKTS. He writes, “[We are] encouraged by initial volume orders from infrastructure customers, and expect infrastructure customer ramp to commence in the June quarter with WiFi customer ramps starting in the September quarter. The company&#39;s revenue guidance reflects expectation for volume filter revenue ramp in the mid-to-late CY20 timeframe…”In line with his optimistic outlook, De Silva puts a Buy rating on the stock, along with a $10 price target. His target suggests a 25% upside potential. (To watch De Silva’s track record, click here)AKTS shares have 5 recent reviews, breaking down as 4 Buys and 1 Hold, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target, $10, matches De Silva’s, indicating that the stock has room for 25% growth in the near future. (See Akoustis price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks) nLight, Inc. (LASR)Our final stock is an interesting player in the industrial laser industry. nLight produces lasers for high-tech manufacturing industries. Its products include fiber-optic lasers, diode systems, single emitters, and diode laser stacks. The company has a world-wide sales base, with customers in the semiconductor, materials processing, electronics, medical, and military sectors.LASR shares are down since last week, when the company reported a fourth quarter earnings loss and revenue beat. At the bottom line, the EPS net loss was 6 cents. On the top line, however, revenues beat the forecast by 12% and came in at $42.9 million. On the downside, the revenue number was a slip of 7.1% year-over-year. LASR shares are down 12% so far in 2020.Reviewing the stock for Stifel Nicolaus, 4-star analyst John Marchetti writes, “[We] expect the company to return to double-digit revenue growth following a challenging 2019. [I]ndustry fundamentals and new product introductions provide a more constructive outlook. We believe nLight&#39;s focus on higher-powered lasers, programmability, and new market applications should provide a strong base to return to growth…”Marchetti gives the stock a Buy recommendation, and raised his price target from $21 to $26, implying an upside potential here of 45%. (To watch Marchetti’s track record, click here)nLight has received 4 Buy ratings and 1 Hold, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus view. The average price target, $24.75, indicates room for a robust 38% premium from the current share price of $17.89.

That’s worrying some investors concerned about the longterm growth prospects of an industry built on a depleting resource.The value of gold, a haven commodity, is driven more by global economics than supply and demand. Any unexpected event -- from a surprising cure for coronavirus to a positive trade deal -- could drop the value significantly. High prices put more gold scrap on the market, low ones increase hoarding and, if miners’ output remains static, so should profits.Increasingly, investors are split between their wish for higher dividends in the short run and the need to assure company stability over the long term. Finding the “best of both worlds” in allocating the rising cash pile is key for the future of the industry, according to Josh Wolfson, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“Miners in general are exposed to significant external factors that are out of their control,” said Simon Jaeger, a portfolio manager at Flossbach von Storch AG, a top-10 investor in both Newmont Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp. “It’s certainly a reason for not paying too much in dividends,” he said. “You want to have the cash buffer on your balance sheet in order to be financially flexible when prices get worse.”Gold prices are currently at a seven-year high as concerns mount that the coronavirus outbreak in Asia will derail global growth. In a sign that the virus is already starting to dent the world’s largest economy, business activity in the U.S. shrank in February for the first time since 2013. The metal jumped as much as 2% on Friday as the S&P 500 Index was posting its first weekly loss since January.Gold producers are “gushing cash,” said John Hathaway, senior portfolio manager at Sprott Asset Management, in support of the higher dividends. “They are in a position to raise their dividend,” he said. “And there will be boardroom pressure and shareholder pressure to do that.”The industry has been blasted in the past for underspending on production, overspending on acquisitions and piling up debt. Now, though, after years of fat-trimming, miners and their investors are well-positioned to gain from the higher prices. That’s allowed companies including Barrick and Newmont to boost free-cash flow and, to varying degrees, reward shareholders.Earlier this month, though, Mark Bristow, Barrick’s chief executive officer, sent a warning shot across the bow of the industry. Even if all current projects work out, he said, gold supply will still fall 30% by 2029. While sinking supply would be bullish for bullion prices, margins and revenues could be hit if companies are forced to mine lower-grade or hard-to-access deposits.The divide between whether to push profits or new production has become more focused this year.Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. offers a case in point of how closely investors are watching the issue. Despite boosting its dividend 14% and forecasting rising production through 2022, Agnico’s shares were punished after it cut its 2020 output guidance earlier this month. In an interview after the results, CEO Sean Boyd argued that dividend increases are important not just as a way of sharing the benefits of higher gold prices, but also because it demonstrates a company’s ability to maintain capital discipline.Success in the changing shareholder landscape is “going to be from the better gold-mining businesses being able to attract new generalist money,” Boyd said by telephone.‘Endless Pit’Steve Land, portfolio manager for the Franklin Gold and Precious Metals Fund, believes the next step for miners is to show the sector is “not just this endless pit of having to pour more and more money in all the time.” The trend toward higher dividends is a way of rebuilding trust and confidence, according to Land. These companies can also take the time to assess future projects, he said, but should be “in no rush to push things forward.”Newmont, meanwhile, seems to be seeking to meet a “best of both worlds” scenario.In January, Newmont said it planned to hike its dividend by 79% to $1 per share annually, effective in April, while maintaining production for the next five years. On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Nancy Buese said the U.S.-based miner was considering “other shareholder friendly actions” it might take.One key consideration “will be to determine our appropriate level of dividend on a go-forward and sustainable basis,” she said.Barrick, meanwhile, announced a 40% dividend hike to 7 cents a share earlier this month. As it sells assets and tackles its debt, the Canada-based miner is hoping to attract generalist investors to its stock. But it also lowered its five-year production guidance and is reevaluating its portfolio mix.Generally, it appears the high-dividend strategy is helping lift gold equities. A Bloomberg Intelligence index of senior gold producers lagged the performance of gold futures for most of the past decade. But in the past 12 months, the gold group is killing it, rising 57% compared with 24% for gold.“If a company has genuine productive opportunities to invest capital in their business at high return, that is always going to be preferable versus paying a dividend,” said RBC’s Wolfson by phone. “But companies which can demonstrate overall discipline by allocating capital effectively -- plus paying out cash flow to shareholders -- I think will ultimately accomplish the best of both worlds.”&#92;--With assistance from Maria Elena Vizcaino.To contact the reporters on this story: Justina Vasquez in New York at jvasquez57@bloomberg.net;Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.net;Steven Frank in Toronto at sfrank9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Reg GaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Nancy Buese said the U.S.-based miner was considering “other shareholder friendly actions” it might take.One key consideration “will be to determine our appropriate level of dividend on a go-forward and sustainable basis,” she said.Barrick, meanwhile, announced a 40% dividend hike to 7 cents a share earlier this month. As it sells assets and tackles its debt, the Canada-based miner is hoping to attract generalist investors to its stock. But it also lowered its five-year production guidance and is reevaluating its portfolio mix.Generally, it appears the high-dividend strategy is helping lift gold equities. A Bloomberg Intelligence index of senior gold producers lagged the performance of gold futures for most of the past decade. But in the past 12 months, the gold group is killing it, rising 57% compared with 24% for gold.“If a company has genuine productive opportunities to invest capital in their business at high return, that is always going to be preferable versus paying a dividend,” said RBC’s Wolfson by phone. “But companies which can demonstrate overall discipline by allocating capital effectively -- plus paying out cash flow to shareholders -- I think will ultimately accomplish the best of both worlds.”&#92;--With assistance from Maria Elena Vizcaino.To contact the reporters on this story: Justina Vasquez in New York at jvasquez57@bloomberg.net;Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.net;Steven Frank in Toronto at sfrank9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Reg GaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">'},\n",

[Investors should] focus on looking at what they&#39;re trying to achieve as a long-term goal.&quot;That, actually, is a very important element of financial planning. In reality, that is [important] when issues like this come up, like the virus or any other issues in the market.&quot;Fong&#39;s view is echoed by Ricky Tang, deputy head of multi-asset product, North Asia, at Schroders.

[Investors should] focus on looking at what they&#39;re trying to achieve as a long-term goal.&quot;That, actually, is a very important element of financial planning. In reality, that is [important] when issues like this come up, like the virus or any other issues in the market.&quot;Fong&#39;s view is echoed by Ricky Tang, deputy head of multi-asset product, North Asia, at Schroders.

Here’s my take, with a bit of artistic license:“The Emperor Salman and the Tailors of Rus”(1) — with apologies to Hans Christian AndersenSalman, Prince of the Desert and Emperor of the lands of OPEC, was worried. The empire over which his country had held sway for nearly 60 years was beset on all sides by threats. His uncle, Sam, who had hitherto depended on the oil from the desert kingdom and its allies, had recently harnessed a wild beast called Shale that was threatening the riches of the realm. Salman needed\\xa0to burnish his image, so he decided to take\\xa0in\\xa0his old\\xa0suit of clothes for a makeover\\xa0to\\xa0restore its luster and his country’s reputation as the most important oil broker in the world.Far to the north, in the frozen lands of Rus, there lived a pair tailors —\\xa0Vladimir and Alexander —\\xa0who, it was reported, could do wonderful things with the fabric called “neft.”Over many months Salman courted Vladimir, persuading him and Alexander to give the\\xa0suit an elegant new\\xa0look fit for an emperor. Eventually, after much deliberation, Vladimir and Alexander agreed. Along with a coterie of assistant tailors from around the globe, they would carefully proceed with\\xa0the alterations. The cuts used would be so fine as to\\xa0be invisible to anyone unworthy of\\xa0their position in life, or hopelessly stupid.The tailors toiled away. At the end of each month they exhibited the progress of their work —\\xa0cuts so subtle\\xa0that the emperor marveled at their skill, even though he couldn’t quite make out where they’d been made. But it would never do for him to admit that he couldn’t see where Vladimir and Alexander had trimmed the fabric. After all, the leaders of the other countries in the\\xa0OPEC empire\\xa0were all so enthusiastic in their praise of the tailors from Rus.Meanwhile, Salman’s kingdom was making sacrifices of its own, giving up vast amounts of treasure as Uncle Sam and the beast Shale began to woo away his friends in the east.No matter. The suit alterations\\xa0were coming along. The cuts\\xa0by the tailors of Rus were things of exquisite beauty, so fine as to be almost invisible.There was only one problem. Clearly quite remarkably stupid, traders in the markets of New York, London, Singapore and other far-flung bazaars were not impressed with the tailors’ work. No matter how long Vladimir and Alexander kept on with their clever snipping, OPEC’s reputation continued to\\xa0wither.Some began to point their fingers. “Those cuts being made by the tailors of Rus are nothing of the sort,” people said. Pretty soon, it became apparent that the Emperor of OPEC had been hoodwinked by the tailors.But the poor emperor was trapped. Salman had invested so much effort in persuading Vladimir to lead the tailors of OPEC+ that it had become impossible to admit that their oh-so-fine cuts were illusory. And then disaster struck!\\xa0 A great pestilence swept the nations of the east, throwing them into disarray and slashing their trade with the Empire of OPEC.Salman called for yet more and more cuts.\\xa0But the tailors were not convinced. They were quite happy with the way things were. After all, the countries of the east were much closer to Rus than they were to the Empire of OPEC, and their own trade was holding up pretty well, thank you. “Let’s wait and see,” they said. “No need to rush into doing something unnecessary.”It was then that it dawned on the poor Emperor of OPEC\\xa0that the tailors of Rus were not the miracle workers he had thought.

Possibly, just possibly, those tailors would\\xa0one day deliver those exquisite cuts they promised,\\xa0maybe after their next get together in March.\\xa0But, the tailors&#39; reluctance to make more cuts left Salman fuming with his closest allies. Perhaps the delicate tie between the emperor and his tailors was beginning to come unstitched.(1) Any similarity to real life events, people and organizations, including Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Energy Minister Alexander Novak or the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, are not coincidental.To contact the author of this story: Julian Lee at jlee1627@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Julian Lee is an oil strategist for Bloomberg.
